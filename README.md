Performance analysis of LoRa networks with Successive Interference Cancellation.

# Abstract
The increase of the connected Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, necessitates the development
of low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs). LoRa technology is a popular and promising solution
for communication in LPWANs. This thesis studies the use of Successive Interference Cancellation
(SIC) to decode received signals in LoRa networks. The proposed method utilises the capture effect
and designs a new receiver structure, capable of retrieving collided packets using SIC. A complete
theoretical analysis is provided and closed-form expressions are derived for the successful 
decoding of packets via SIC taking path loss, fading, noise, and interference into account. The
theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations.
